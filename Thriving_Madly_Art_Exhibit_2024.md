## My Experience of Thriving Madly

I found that Thriving Madly a welcome space that take me as I am and how I am feeling on that day. I do not have to hide I am having a bad day or not coping. Enabling to be present and participate with whatever capicity I have on the day. That multiple experience and worldview are welcome and accoummodated for in respectful way. Giving oppurnity for growth and development.
