## Interpretation
To me it is re-evolutionary act to recover from trauma and to break the chains of the abuse cycle. I think this because It takes effort to change bad habit from trauma but very little efort to continue it. Pasting it on the generation to deal with. I can this second degree tramua. I feel I have put a lot effort into re-evolutionise my headspace from the thinking created by abuse. This includes therapy, learning about pyschology and mental health, a stay in psycharitic hosipital care and mental residential care, bullet journaling and peotry writing, peer support and counselling, having supportive and understanding friends. It takes a Multiple dispinary approach to get re-evlutionay result because truama is a multiple dispinary failure. 

The way idea of re-evolution to my maddness is that it takes bravery to confidently say " I am Mad and still worthy of existing " and to actually believe that. That I have something to give to world. To own my madness is re-evolutionary act despite the reality of discrimination I face because of it. To fight for existing  beyond the discrimination. To fight for every breath in my body even ont the days I absolutely wan to die. To Fight for existing proudly as the mad me. These is are my re-evolutionary action.
